So I've been thinking about this thing that happened last week. I was at the grocery store, and I was in the cereal aisle, and I just... I froze. I couldn't pick one. There were like forty different options and I just stood there for probably five minutes. And this woman walked past me twice and gave me this look like, is this guy okay?

And it made me think about something. Like, we talk about decision fatigue all the time, right? But I don't think that's really what was happening. I think what was happening is I didn't actually want cereal. I was buying cereal because that's what I do on Sunday mornings. It's this routine I've had since college. But I realized standing there that I haven't actually enjoyed cereal in... maybe years?

It's funny how we keep doing things just because we've always done them. Like, nobody is making me eat cereal. My mom's not here saying you have to have a balanced breakfast or whatever. I'm a grown man. I could have eggs. I could have nothing. I could have leftover pizza, which honestly sounds way better.

So I left. I just walked out of the aisle without buying anything. And I felt this weird mix of guilt and freedom. The guilt was like, you came here to buy cereal, you're supposed to buy cereal. And the freedom was like, wait, I can just... not?

I've been noticing this pattern more and more. All these little rules I follow that I never actually agreed to. Like checking email first thing in the morning. Why do I do that? It immediately puts me in reactive mode. Someone else's priorities become my priorities before I've even had coffee. But I've done it every day for probably fifteen years.

Or the way I always say yes to coffee meetings. Someone reaches out, wants to pick my brain, and I say yes because... that's what you do? That's what helpful people do? But then I'm sitting there an hour later thinking about all the things I could be doing instead, and I'm not even fully present because part of my brain is elsewhere.

My friend Rohan, he has this thing where he asks himself: would I be excited about this if it were happening tomorrow? Not in two weeks when it feels abstract, but tomorrow. And if the answer is no, he doesn't do it. I thought that was kind of extreme when he first told me, but now I think he might be onto something.

Because here's the thing I'm realizing: most of the stuff I feel obligated to do, nobody actually cares if I do it or not. The cereal company doesn't care. The person who wants the coffee meeting will find someone else. My inbox will survive if I don't check it until ten AM. The world keeps spinning.

But I act like it won't. I act like if I don't maintain all these little routines and obligations, everything will fall apart. And that's... that's a lot of pressure to put on yourself over cereal, you know?

I think maybe the real question isn't what should I do, but why am I doing this in the first place? And if I can't come up with a good answer, maybe I just... stop?

I don't know. I'm still figuring this out. But I did have eggs this morning instead of cereal. And they were pretty good. Nothing revolutionary happened. The day went on. But there was this small moment of like, oh, I chose this. This was actually my choice.

Maybe that's the whole thing. Maybe it's not about making big dramatic changes to your life. Maybe it's just about noticing all the tiny places where you've given away your agency without realizing it, and just... taking a little bit of it back. One bowl of cereal at a time. Or, I guess, one bowl of cereal not eaten at a time.

Anyway, that's what I've been thinking about this week. The grocery store philosophy hour, brought to you by the cereal aisle at Whole Foods.
